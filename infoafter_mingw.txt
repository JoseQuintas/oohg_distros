Note that the settings in the batch files are defaults and that they will work if you installed OOHG at C:\OOHG.

If you installed OOHG f.e.to F:\OOHG, you must set this environment variable:
set HG_ROOT=F:\OOHG

For more information, please read the batch files or ask questions in the user's support group.
