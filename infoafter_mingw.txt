If you're going to use batch files "compile.bat" and/or "buildlib.bat" to build your apps it's really convenient to add "C:\OOHG" (or your selected folder) to the PATH environment variable.

Note that the settings in the batch files are defaults, and that they will only work if you installed OOHG at C:\OOHG.

If you installed this package f.e. to F:\OOHG, before executing a batch file you must set this environment variable:
set HG_ROOT=F:\OOHG

For more information, please read the batch files or ask questions in the user's support group.
