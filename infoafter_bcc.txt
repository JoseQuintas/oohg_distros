If you're going to use batch file "compile.bat" to build your apps it's really convenient to add "C:\OOHG" (or your selected folder) to the PATH environment variable.

Before start using OOHG you will need Borland C/C++ 5.5 compiler (BCC) installed in your hard disk. You can download a copy from http://www.whosaway.com/

Note that the settings in the batch files are defaults, and that they will only work if you installed this package at C:\OOHG and BCC at C:\BORLAND\BCC55.

If you installed this package f.e. to F:\OOHG, before executing a batch file you must set this environment variable:
set HG_ROOT=F:\OOHG

If you installed BCC f.e. to F:\BCC, before executing a batch file you must set this environment variable:
set HG_BCC=F:\BCC

For more information, please read the batch files or ask questions in the user's support group.
