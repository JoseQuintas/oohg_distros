Before start using OOHG you will need Borland C/C++ 5.5 compiler (BCC) installed in your hard disk. You can download a copy from http://www.whosaway.com/

Note that the settings in the batch files are defaults and that they will work if you installed OOHG at C:\OOHG and BCC at C:\BORLAND\BCC55.

If you installed OOHG f.e.to F:\OOHG, you must set this environment variable:
set HG_ROOT=F:\OOHG

If you installed BCC f.e.to F:\BCC, you must set this environment variable:
set HG_BCC=F:\BCC

For more information, please read the batch files or ask questions in the user's support group.
